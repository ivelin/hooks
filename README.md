  React Hooks for Ethereum and Kali DAO Apps
<p>

<br>

Kali Hooks is a Rect Hooks library that aims to simplify development of Kali DAO based web3 apps. Kali Hooks extends the [wagmi hooks](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/wagmi) library and follows the wagmi best practices.

## Features

- ðŸš€ React hooks for working with Kali DAO EVM contracts.
- ðŸ‘Ÿ Caching, request deduplication, multicall, batching, and persistence
- ðŸ¦„ TypeScript ready

## Hooks

### useChainGuard

Checks if the user is connected to a target chain. Useful for preventing users from writing to contracts on the wrong chain.

Example React component snippet:

```TypeScript
import { useChainGuard } from 'kalidao-hooks'

const daoHomeChain = chain.arbitrum
const { isUserOnCorrectChain, isUserConnected, userChain } = useChainGuard({ chainId: daoHomeChain.id })

let wrongChainWarning
if (!isUserOnCorrectChain) {
  wrongChainWarning = (!isUserConnected) ?
    wrongChainWarning = `Your Web3 wallet is disconnected. Please connect to ${daoHomeChain.name}.`
    :
    wrongChainWarning = `Your Web3 wallet is connected to ${userChain.name}. Please switch to ${daoHomeChain.name}.`
}

```

## Installation

Install Kali Hooks and its peer dependencies.

```bash
npm install @kalidao/hooks wagmi ethers
